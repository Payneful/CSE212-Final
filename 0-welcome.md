<br>This is an overview of 3 different data structures in python they are: [Stack](https://github.com/payneful/CSE212-Final/blob/main/1-stack.md), [Set](https://github.com/payneful/CSE212-Final/blob/main/2-set.md) and [Tree](https://github.com/payneful/CSE212-Final/blob/main/3-tree.md). Each one will be explained in with many details and with different visual representations and example code. At the end of each data structure there will be a problem to work on with a provided solution to that problem.
